# project


• Non-Invasive Glucose Monitoring: Arduino-based breath analysis system for diabetes tracking without blood sampling.

• Approach: MQ138 gas sensor converts breath VOCs into blood glucose level calculations using specialized algorithms.

• Hardware Setup: Uses Arduino Nano, gas sensor, and C/C++ programming for real-time health monitoring.

• Benefits: Pain-free, cost-effective, frequent testing with continuous health tracking.

• Future Vision: Plans for AI integration, mobile app development, and comprehensive clinical validation studies.
